## Sublime Text Packages I regularly use:

- Alignment
- BracketHighlighter
- Color Highlighter
- Emmet
- GitGutter
- Markdown Preview
- SidebarEnhancements
- DocBlockr
- AutoFileName

I also install different sytax highlighting packages as needed, such as for Stylus, Sass, and Jade.

## Current Theme:

- Cobalt2 (I'm also using it's color scheme)
- I have in the past regularly used PreDawn.

## Installing Packages

Definitely use Package Control. Installation directions are [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

After you install that and restart Sublime, then hit Shift + Command + P to open the command pallette, type 'install' and hit enter. This will allow you to search through the available packages and themes.

The [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) site will also let you search through popular packages and get documentation.

## Opening Sublime from the Command Line

I also always open Sublime from the command line. Here's the official line on setting that up: [https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html). If that doesn't work, you can also just create an alias for it in your bash profile.
